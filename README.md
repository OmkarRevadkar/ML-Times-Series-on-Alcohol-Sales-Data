This project deals with the forecasting of alcohol sales for the next 12 months from the year Feb 2020. The dataset used here is on alcohol sales. The series is made a univariate time series having only one variable i.e 'sales' and is further checked for the stationarity. As the original series is not stationary, it is made stationary using the differencing technique. Once stationarity is achieved, we try to trace the patterns using seasonal_decompose(). On the basis of patterns, we decide the type of model to be used to forecast. Like in this case, we got a pattern of uptrend and seasonality, so we chose SARIMAX model. Using auto_arima, important parameters are passed into SARIMAX(). Model is built and predictions are made. Finally, to visualise, we plot the actual and forecasted values on matplotlib. 
Predictions made are found to be following the current trend and seasonal pattern indicating that the forecast is done in the right direction and is appropriate.
